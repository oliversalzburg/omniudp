# omniudp

> [!CAUTION]
> omniudp is still a fun example of how to publish RFID signal data to various consumers. The project is mature and was working as intended throughout its lifetime.
> Today, I no longer have any personal or professional use for this project. If someone can still draw inspiration from this project, that would be awesome, but I can no longer maintain it. Thus, it has been **archived as of 2024-08-11**.
